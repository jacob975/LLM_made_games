"""
Summary of projectile collision fixes for Tower Defense Game
"""

# PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
# - Projectiles were dying when they reached the original target position
# - This prevented them from hitting other enemies even if they were in the path
# - Collision detection radius was too small
# - Players couldn't damage enemies if they "missed the first one"

# FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

# 1. PROJECTILE LIFETIME MANAGEMENT
# - Changed projectiles to die based on maximum travel distance instead of reaching target
# - This allows projectiles to continue traveling and hit other enemies
# - Prevents infinite projectile travel with max_range parameter

# 2. IMPROVED COLLISION DETECTION  
# - Increased collision radius from (enemy.radius + 8) to (enemy.radius + 25)
# - This makes it much easier for projectiles to hit enemies
# - More forgiving gameplay that feels better for players

# 3. BETTER PROJECTILE PHYSICS
# - Projectiles now track their starting position
# - Travel distance is calculated from start, not target
# - More realistic projectile behavior

# BENEFITS:
# ✅ Projectiles can hit any enemy in their path, not just the original target
# ✅ More forgiving collision detection improves gameplay feel
# ✅ No more "missed the first enemy, can't hit anything" problem
# ✅ Better tower effectiveness and player satisfaction
# ✅ Maintains game balance while improving mechanics
